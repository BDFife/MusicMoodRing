# MusicMoodRing

Determine a friend's mood based on their music listening history. At the moment, this only works with Last.fm

This project was originally created as part of the [Rethink Music Hacker's Weekend](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/rethink-music-hackers-weekend) in Boston on April 21-22nd 2012.

This project was ported over to its [current git repository](https://github.com/BDFife/MusicMoodRing) as part of a bigger project to convert all my Hack Weekend project to hosting on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). 

My other projects can be found [here](http://www.sodesne.com/projects).
