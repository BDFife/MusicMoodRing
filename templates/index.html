      <h1>Music Mood Ring</h1>
  
        <p> Figure out the mood of a last.fm listener based on the themes
        and moods of the albums they are listening to. </p>

        <p> Start with something basic. Check out a LFM recently
        played list by accessing /get/mood/username. </p>

        <p> Please bear in mind that a lot of API queries are made
        when you call this, so it may take a while (10-30s) to
        return. <p>
